                             My name is Md Abu Talha Ibna Riaz Hassan. My Matric Number is A20EC3022 and this is the assignment of
                             Web Programming Section 7.
                             This is my profile page. In here I talk about myself, my hobbies, my accomplishments
                            and my dreams in life.
                             
                            <br> <br>
                             I am 19 years old, I was born in November 6th, 2003 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I still live here with my parents and my brother. 
                             My father is the Vice President of Dhaka Bank and 
                             my mother is a house wife.
                            My brother is in high school and he is 13 years old. 

                            I am a very competitive and hard working person. Although I enjoy the company of others I mostly prefer to stay alone and enjoy
                            my alone time. I am also really into books and music, these are the 2 things that I certainly cannot live without. I mostly like 80s rock and metal bands. 
                            <br><br>
                            Some of my favourite bands are: <br>

            <p>
                I would describe myself as a fun loving, hard-working person. 
                <br>I like to stay ahead of things and be stress free (although it does not help a lot since I suffer from anxiety).
                In my spare time, I like to go to fancy restaurants with my friends.
                I go to these places not because I like to eat alot, but because I enjoy the company of my closest friends.
                
               
                I also like to program and make toy programs during my spare time. <br>I am really into technology and I want to get a job as a programmer after I graduate.
                <br>Some of the programming languages that I have used are Java, Javascript, C++, Python, C etc.<br> I am really into problem solving and mathematics so I hope I get a job as a Backend Engineer when I graduate.

                My goal in life is to be happy and keep the people around me happy. Above all I want to be good and kind person.
                <br> Jordan Peterson once said <u><i>"You should write down where you want to see yourself in 5 years.<br> That way it will always be in your head that you need to accomplish something"</i></u>
                So I too made a list. In that list I wrote: <br>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>I want to be successful</li>
                    <li>I want to be make my parents proud</li>
                    <li>I want to give back to my parents</li>
                    <li>I want to have life long friendships with the friends I currently have</li>
                    <li>And I want to adopt a cat</li>
                </ol>
